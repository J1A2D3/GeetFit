## Background Color
US1
This ABtest would track user retention
The idea behind this test is to see whether user like the current look of our application.  It would be better for users to find our app appealing and this may affect user retention.
To test this, an ABtest would be created where a hex value for the background color is different than our current color.  We would probably deploy this to 50% of user (or greater).  the metric we're most concerned with is user retention.
