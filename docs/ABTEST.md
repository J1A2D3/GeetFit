## Background Color
US1
This ABtest would track user retention
The idea behind this test is to see whether user like the current look of our application.  It would be better for users to find our app appealing and this may affect user retention.
To test this, an ABtest would be created where a hex value for the background color is different than our current color.  We would probably deploy this to 50% of user (or greater).  the metric we're most concerned with is user retention.


## Text Color Contrast Optimization
- A/B Test Name: Text Color Contrast Optimization
- User Story Number: US1
- Metrics:
    - Engagement: Click-through rates (CTR) on key call-to-action (CTA) buttons.
    - Adoption: Form submission rates and conversions.
    - Retention: Returning user percentage.
- Hypothesis:  We believe that changing the text color to improve contrast will enhance readability, leading to increased user engagement and conversion rates. If users find the text easier to read, they will stay longer on the platform, interact more with key elements, and be more likely to complete desired actions.
- What Problem Are We Trying to Solve?  Currently, we suspect that low-contrast text on our platform is reducing readability, which may contribute to lower engagement and conversion rates. Users may struggle to quickly comprehend the information, causing frustration and increased bounce rates. By optimizing text color, we aim to improve the user experience, reduce cognitive load, and ultimately drive higher engagement and conversions.
- Experiment: We will allocate 100% of our users to the experiment (A/B split) to ensure a statistically significant sample size. The test will be conducted on both new and returning users.
- Tracking Using Firebase Analytics: Page session duration
  - Click-through rates (CTR) on CTA buttons
  - Form completion rates
- Variations:
    - Control (A): Current text color
    - Variant (B): Adjusted text color with higher contrast to improve readability



## Logo Design Optimization
- A/B Test Name: Logo Design Optimization  
- User Story Number:US1  
- Metrics:
  - Engagement: Click-through rates (CTR) on homepage or navigation bar (if applicable)
  - Adoption: Sign-up or onboarding completion rates
  - Retention: Returning visitor percentage and frequency of visits

- Hypothesis:
  We believe that updating our logo to a more modern or visually appealing version will create a stronger first impression, enhancing brand perception and trust. This could lead to increased user engagement, higher sign-up rates, and better retention.

- What Problem Are We Trying to Solve?
  Our current logo may not be as visually appealing or impactful as it could be, potentially affecting brand perception and user trust. First-time users might judge the overall quality of the platform based on branding. A refreshed logo could improve perception and encourage deeper engagement.

- Experiment:
  We will allocate 50% of users to the control group (original logo) and 50% to the variant group (new logo). The logo will appear across key screens including the homepage, navigation bar, and onboarding process.

- Tracking Using Firebase Analytics:
  - Logo impression count (if tracked separately)
  - Click-through rates (CTR) on logo or nearby navigation items
  - Page/session duration
  - Onboarding completion rates
  - Returning visitor percentage

- Variations:
  - Control (A): Original logo  
  - Variant (B): New logo design
