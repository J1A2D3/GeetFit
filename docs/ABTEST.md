## Background Color
US1
This ABtest would track user retention
The idea behind this test is to see whether user like the current look of our application.  It would be better for users to find our app appealing and this may affect user retention.
To test this, an ABtest would be created where a hex value for the background color is different than our current color.  We would probably deploy this to 50% of user (or greater).  the metric we're most concerned with is user retention.


## Text Color Contrast Optimization
- A/B Test Name: Text Color Contrast Optimization
- User Story Number: US1
- Metrics:
    - Engagement: Click-through rates (CTR) on key call-to-action (CTA) buttons.
    - Adoption: Form submission rates and conversions.
    - Retention: Returning user percentage.
- Hypothesis:  We believe that changing the text color to improve contrast will enhance readability, leading to increased user engagement and conversion rates. If users find the text easier to read, they will stay longer on the platform, interact more with key elements, and be more likely to complete desired actions.
- What Problem Are We Trying to Solve?  Currently, we suspect that low-contrast text on our platform is reducing readability, which may contribute to lower engagement and conversion rates. Users may struggle to quickly comprehend the information, causing frustration and increased bounce rates. By optimizing text color, we aim to improve the user experience, reduce cognitive load, and ultimately drive higher engagement and conversions.
- Experiment: We will allocate 100% of our users to the experiment (A/B split) to ensure a statistically significant sample size. The test will be conducted on both new and returning users.
- Tracking Using Firebase Analytics: Page session duration
  - Click-through rates (CTR) on CTA buttons
  - Form completion rates
- Variations:
    - Control (A): Current text color
    - Variant (B): Adjusted text color with higher contrast to improve readability
